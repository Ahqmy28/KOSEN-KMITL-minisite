        <p style="text-indent: 50px">
            KOSEN-KMITL is an educational institution established under the Human Resources Development Project in Engineering, Technology, and Innovation. 
            The institute supports investment and enhances the capabilities of the industrial sector in the country and region. It was established according 
            to the Cabinet resolution on December 4, 2018, with the Office of the Basic Education Commission and the Institute for the Promotion of Teaching 
            Science and Technology being responsible for the project as proposed by the Ministry of Education.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px">
            The Human Resources Development Project in Engineering, Technology, and Innovation aligns with the Thailand 4.0 policy, which supports investment 
            and enhances the capabilities of the industrial sector in the country and region. It also focuses on developing human resources in science, 
            technology, and innovation with high knowledge and potential to play a key role in promoting targeted industries, both existing and future 
            industries. Moreover, it is an essential part of driving the country with innovative and creative advancements. In addition to increasing the 
            number of quality personnel in the group of practical engineers to meet demand, the project can also attract foreign companies, such as from Japan, 
            to invest more in Thailand.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px">
            The KOSEN Institute of KMITL is overseen by the Thai-KOSEN Institute, with a minister serving as the chairman of the executive board to ensure that 
            operations comply with the agreements between the Thai and Japanese governments. However, to ensure that the operations of the KOSEN-KMITL comply 
            with the Higher Education Act, KMITL has established the institute as a department, under the supervision of the KOSEN Institute's executive board.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px">
            Moreover, to ensure that the academic operations of the KOSEN-KMITL align with the objectives approved by the Cabinet, KMITL has entered into 
            a cooperation agreement with NIT Japan to develop the curriculum of the KOSEN-KMITL to align with the MCC (Main Core Curriculum), which is the core 
            curriculum of the KOSEN Institutes in Japan. To ensure that the teaching and learning of the KOSEN-KMITL follow the set curriculum, NIT has sent 
            expert faculty members to serve as models and to prepare and develop Thai faculty members to gain experience and expertise in mathematics, science, 
            engineering, and technology according to the KOSEN model in Japan.</p>
