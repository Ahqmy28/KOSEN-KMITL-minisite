            The KOSEN Institute of King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KOSEN - KMITL) or the KOSEN Institute of KMITL is an educational 
            institution established under the Human Resources Development Project in Engineering, Technology, and Innovation. The institute supports 
            investment and enhances the capabilities of the industrial sector in the country and region. It was established according to the Cabinet 
            resolution on December 4, 2018, with the Office of the Basic Education Commission and the Institute for the Promotion of Teaching Science 
            and Technology being responsible for the project as proposed by the Ministry of Education. <br />
            The Human Resources Development Project in Engineering, Technology, and Innovation aligns with the Thailand 4.0 policy, which supports 
            investment and enhances the capabilities of the industrial sector in the country and region, especially in the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC). 
            It also focuses on developing human resources in science, technology, and innovation with high knowledge and potential to play a key role in 
            promoting targeted industries, both existing and future industries. Moreover, it is an essential part of driving the country with innovative 
            and creative advancements. In addition to increasing the number of quality personnel in the group of practical engineers to meet demand, 
            the project can also attract foreign companies, such as from Japan, to invest more in Thailand. Therefore, the Thai government has signed an 
            agreement with the Japanese government under a Japanese government loan project that provides assistance and support in education and academics 
            to achieve the set objectives. <br />
            The KOSEN Institute of KMITL is overseen by the Thai-KOSEN Institute, with a minister serving as the chairman of the executive board to ensure 
            that operations comply with the agreements between the Thai and Japanese governments. However, to ensure that the operations of the KOSEN 
            Institute of KMITL comply with the Higher Education Act, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang has established the KOSEN Institute 
            of KMITL as a department within the institute, under the supervision of the KOSEN Institute's executive board. <br />
            Moreover, to ensure that the academic operations of the KOSEN Institute of KMITL align with the objectives approved by the Cabinet, 
            King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang has entered into a cooperation agreement with NIT (National Institute of Technology) Japan 
            to develop the curriculum of the KOSEN Institute of KMITL to align with the MCC (Main Core Curriculum), which is the core curriculum of 
            the KOSEN Institutes in Japan. To ensure that the teaching and learning of the KOSEN Institute of KMITL follow the set curriculum, NIT has sent 
            expert faculty members to serve as models and to prepare and develop Thai faculty members to gain experience and expertise in mathematics, science, 
            engineering, and technology according to the KOSEN model in Japan.
